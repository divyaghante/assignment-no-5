Sequences Practice Problems
1) Use Random Function (( RANDOM )) to get Single Digit
solution=$ echo $(($RANDOM % 10))
2. Use Random to get Dice Number between 1 to 6 
solution=$(( ( RANDOM % 10 ) + 1))
         $(( ( RANDOM % 5 + 1 ))
3. Add two Random Dice Number and Print the Result
solution = 
 #! /bin/bash 
 dice1=$((RANDOM%6))
 dice2=$((RANDOM%6))
 sum=$((dice1+dice2))
 echo=$sum
4. Write a program that reads 5 Random 2 Digit values , then find their  sum and the average 
solution=
#!/bin/bash

echo "Please enter your first number: "
read a
echo "Second number: "
read b
echo "Third number: "
read c
echo "Fourth number: "
read d
echo "Fifth number: "
read e

sum=$(($a + $b + $c + $d + $e))
avg=$(echo $sum / 5 | bc -l ) 


echo "The sum of these numbers is: " $sum
echo "The average of these numbers is: " $avg


Output=
Please enter your first number: 
2
Second number: 
2
Third number: 
2
Fourth number: 
3
Fifth number: 
2
The sum of these numbers is:  11
The average of these numbers is:  2.20000000000000000000

5. Unit Conversion  
a. 1ft = 12 in then 42 in = 3 feet 6 inches  
b. Rectangular Plot of 60 feet x 40 feet in meters =731.52 m (in square meter is 218)
c. Calculate area of 25 such plots in acres=4.51 acre
